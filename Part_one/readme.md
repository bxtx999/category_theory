# 1. 范畴：构成的本质

A category is an embarrassingly simple concept.A category consists of objects and arrows that go between them. That’s why categories are so easy to represent pictorially An object can be drawn as a circle or a point, and an arrow … is an arrow. (Just for variety, I will occasionally draw objects as piggies and arrows as fireworks.) But the essence of a category is composition. Or, if you prefer, the essence of composition is a category. Arrows compose, so if you have an arrow from object A to object B, and another arrow from object 𝐵 to object 𝐶, then there must be an arrow - their composition - that goes from A to C.

范畴是一个令人尴尬的简单概念.一个范畴由对象和它们之间的箭头组成。这就是为什么类别很容易用图形表示的原因，一个物体可以画成一个圆或一个点，而一个箭头......就是一个箭头（为了多样化，我偶尔会把物体画成小猪，把箭头画成烟花）。但范畴的本质是构成。或者，如果你愿意，构成的本质是一个范畴。箭头组成，所以如果你有一个箭头从物体 A 到物体 B，又有一个箭头从物体 𝐵 到物体 𝐶，那么它们的组成一定有一个箭头从A到C。
