# 1.1 作为函数的箭头

Is this already too much abstract nonsense? Do not despair. Let’s talk concretes. Think of arrows, which are also called *morphisms*, as functions. You have a function 𝑔 that takes an argument of type 𝐵 and returns a 𝐶. You have another function 𝑕 that takes a 𝐶 and returns a 𝐷.

In a category, if there is an arrow going from 𝐵 to 𝐶 and an arrow going from 𝐶 to 𝐷 then there
must also be a direct arrow from 𝐵 to 𝐷  that is their composition. This diagram is not a full category  because it’s missing identity morphisms (see later).

You can compose them by passing the result of f to g. You have just defined a new function that takes an 𝐵 and returns a 𝐷.
